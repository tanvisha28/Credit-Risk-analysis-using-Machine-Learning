# Credit Risk Assessment Using Machine Learning
 Finance and Banking Sector

---

## Objective of the Project

The objective of this project is to develop a machine-learning model that can assess credit risk accurately using the German Credit Data. By analyzing and modelling this data, we aim to predict the likelihood of a credit applicant being a good or bad risk.

## Steps Executed

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**: Initial data analysis, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing distributions and relationships between variables.
3. **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most relevant features for the model.
4. **Model Building**: Constructing various machine learning models for classification.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Utilizing metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC for model assessment.
6. **Model Selection and Tuning**: Choosing the optimal model and fine-tuning hyperparameters.

## Why This Project Is Useful

This project provides insights into the critical factors influencing credit risk and demonstrates the efficacy of machine learning in financial risk assessment. Financial institutions can leverage this model to enhance their decision-making process regarding credit approvals, thereby reducing the risk of credit defaults.

## Key Results

- The Logistic Regression model initially showed high performance.
- The application of SMOTE greatly improved model accuracy.
- After tuning, the XGBoost model exhibited the highest accuracy and ROC-AUC.

## Key Insights from the Project

- **SMOTE's Impact**: Addressing class imbalance was crucial for improving model performance.
- **Feature Engineering**: Custom features like DebtIncomeRatio and AgeCategory significantly enhanced predictive power.
- **Model Complexity vs. Performance**: More complex models required extensive tuning but provided better results.
- **Variable Importance**: DurationMonths, Purpose, and CreditHistory were significant predictors.

## Getting Started with the Project

To get started with this project:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to get the dataset and code.
